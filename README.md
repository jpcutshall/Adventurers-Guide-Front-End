# Adventurers-Guide-Front-End
Adventurer's guide is  a fullstack application MERN stack using google maps api to share knowledge of locations for hiking, fishing, hunting. meant to be shared by users and purely on user knowledge like wiki without sources. i had a lot of ideas for this but completed it in quick time. my deployment on heroku is not setup right and need to get it reconfigured to work properly on heroku. I can give a demo when asked.
